## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, please email dev [a t] zachm . uk (change '[a t]' to an @ and remove spaces)

## Updates

Updates are not guaranteed, as this is a side project for me. If an issue is raised with me, I will attempt to resolve it as soon as I can but I am busy with other matters.

## Web UI

The code for the Web UI is bad. It may be vunerable, but it works. Don't expose it to the Internet and you should be fine. 
My method for communication between the PHP and VB program is a bodge, it could mean someone can fill your hard drive up with data, but I don't care and take no responsability.

## Disclaimer

I take no responsability for any issues that my bad code may cause. If you get hacked or your computer catches fire, I take no responsability.
